INPUT

First line: The number of tests to execute;
Next lines: Sets of boxes

A Set box has the format:
First line: The number of boxes on the set.
Next lines: Three space-separated values representing each box from the set.

Example with 1 test and the set { {1, 2, 3} , { 3, 4, 5 } } :

1
2
1 2 3
3 4 5

OUTPUT

The number representing the maximum possible height of the stack made by the provided set of boxes.

___

TESTING

geraCasos.sh will, through a parameter N, generate a set of N boxes containing random variables. Check the files casos.entrada for the input, and casos.resposta for the correct answers.

	Example: ./geraCasos.sh 7

testes.sh receives the two files `casos.*` as inputs and tries to check for a possible processing timeout that surpasses 20 seconds, and checks for if the answers fit with the sets.
